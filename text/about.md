## Welcome to the Polar Bear Population Projection Explorer!

<br>

#### Note to Casey and Nathan:
<br>
I'm pivoting away from the desert tortoise idea to do a polar bear population projection instead. I haven't fully fleshed out my plan for the projection yet, so I don't yet know what types of widgets I want on the third tab. I'll come to office hours to discuss.

I'm going to use the population matrices from the paper cited below to proect population trends using the popdemo package. I'm planning to include visualizations of the study area map, widgets controlling different population parameters, and widgets incorporating climate change models (which is a work in progress)
